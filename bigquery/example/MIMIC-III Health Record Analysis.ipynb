    "**Why use Ponder for healthcare data analysis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've gotten a taste of the types of analysis you could do with Ponder. Let's take a step back and look at why Ponder is an excellent fit for clinicians and healthcare providers looking to perform healthcare data analysis in your data warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **It's secure.** Healthcare data analysis often involves working with sensitive Personal Identifiable Health (PIH) data stored securely by the healthcare provider or hospital. Typically, working with pandas requires pulling the data out of the data warehouse before you can work with pandas on your local machine. This increases the risks of data leakage or unauthorized disclosures. With Ponder, all the pandas operations are being pushed down to the warehouse, with the computation happening entirely in the warehouse. This means that IT teams can enforce the same access and security controls as the warehouse.\n",
    "- **It's scalable.** The volume of healthcare data has been exponential over the past few years and continues to grow. This presents significant opportunities and challenges ahead for health data management. When working with pandas, [scalability bottlenecks related to memory and performance](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/scale.html) often make analyzing large datasets impossible without resorting to big data frameworks such as Spark. With Ponder, you are no longer limited to the confines of in-memory analytics with pandas. Since the computation is happening entirely on the warehouse, Ponder inherits the parallelism and scalability of your warehouse. In fact, we have shown that Ponder works on workloads involving [more than a terabyte of data](https://ponder.io/run-pandas-on-1tb-directly-in-your-data-warehouse/). This is incredibly useful not just for analyzing electronic health records across a large population of patients, but also for large scale genomic analysis, which are often terabyte-scale and more. \n",
    "- **It's plain vanilla pandas.** Python is the de facto tool for data science, used by [one in every two software developers](https://ponder.io/pandas-is-now-as-popular-as-python-was-in-2016/) and [more than 90%](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/surveys/Kaggle%20State%20of%20Machine%20Learning%20and%20Data%20Science%20Report%202022.pdf) of all data scientists. Among healthcare data practitioners and life scientists, it is also rapidly growing in popularity thanks to the increasing number of [health informatics programs](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/health-informatics) offered by [universities](https://healthinformatics.ucsf.edu/) and [online courses](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/genomic-data-science). Ponder gives you the exact same look-and-feel of pandas, but runnning directly in your warehouse, without requiring you to write a single line of SQL or Spark. Our mission at Ponder is to empower a wider number of domain specialist and practitioners to more easily work with the production-scale data in their warehouse, while sticking with their familiar API.
