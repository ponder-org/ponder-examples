    "Ponder lets you run your pandas code directly in your data warehouse. This means that you can continue to write pandas, but with the scalability and security benefits of a modern data warehouse. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data science at all scales**: With Ponder's technology, the same pandas workflows can be run at all scales, from megabytes to terabytes, without changing a single line of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **No change to user workflow:** Data scientists can continue running their existing pandas workflows and writing pandas code in their favorite IDE of choice, and benefit from seamless scalability improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Simplify your data infrastructure:** No need to set up and maintain compute infrastructure required for other parallel processing frameworks (e.g., Spark, Ray, Dask, etc.) to perform large scale data analysis with pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Guaranteed security:** All your pandas workflows will be executed in BigQuery, thus benefiting from the rigorous security guarantees offered by BigQuery."
